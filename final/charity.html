  <h1 class="ptitle">Give it all #forthekids</h1>
  <p>I got into charity work through some friends on Twitch. They had a team, <a href="https://gamers4change.org">Gamers4Change</a>, that did fundraisers, so I joined. Here's a bit about the charities I currently support:</p>

  <div class="ex2box">
    <h2 class="h2m">St. Jude Children's Research Hospitals</h2>
    <h3 class="h3m"><a href="https://fundraising.stjude.org/site/Donation2?df_id=3560&PROXY_ID=4005735&PROXY_TYPE=20&FR_ID=58984"><img src="../images/stjude.jpeg"></a></h3>
    <p> I love kids. I have kids. If something happened to one of my kids, I would hope that an organization like St. Jude's would be there to help.
      That's why I support them. Our team raised over $120,000 this year during a PLAYLIVE 7-day marathon. It was amazing. And we're still going.
      The image above takes you to my donations page. Help keep the doors open and toss a few bucks their way. #forthekids</p>

  <div class="ex2box">
    <h2 class="h2m">Extra Life (Children's Miracle Network)</h2>
    <h3 class="h3m"><iframe src="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=widgets.250x170ribbon&participantID=207468" width="252" height="172" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="http://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&participantID=207468">Make a Donation!</a></iframe></h3>
    <p>I lived in Tennessee most of my later years before my military service. East Tennesse Children's Hospital helps treat thousands of children
      every year, and support their families during such difficult times. Donating to my page will directly support ETCH as part of the Children's
       Miracle Network. Click the badge now to go to my page and help out. #forthekids</p>
